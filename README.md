# Javascript-Learning
This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript, covering core concepts and practical examples. It includes topics such as variables, data types, functions, loops, DOM manipulation, events, and asynchronous programming. The goal is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript and apply it to real-world web development projects
